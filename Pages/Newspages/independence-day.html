            <p>The 77th Independence Day was indeed a momentous occasion at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, celebrated with an unparalleled zeal and fervour on the 15th of August 2023, a Tuesday that marked the legacy of India's freedom struggle. The entire campus was bathed in the resplendent colours of the national flag, radiating pride and glory for our incredible nation.<br><br>
                The centrepiece of the day's festivities was the flag hoisting ceremony at the Kalpana Chawla Ground, situated opposite the esteemed Periyar EVR Central Library. The responsibility of hoisting the tricolour was entrusted to none other than the Honourable Chancellor, Dr. G. Viswanathan, a revered figure in the institution known for his dedication to education and nation-building. The solemn ceremony commenced at 9:00 a.m., with an air of anticipation and reverence in the hearts of all who had gathered to witness this historic moment.<br><br>
                As the national flag soared high into the sky, fluttering with grace and dignity, a profound sense of unity and patriotism filled the air. The melodious strains of the national anthem resonated through the grounds, stirring the hearts of every attendee with a deep sense of belonging to this great nation.<br><br>
                Following the flag hoisting, the NCC (National Cadet Corps) students took centre stage with a spirited march past. Dressed immaculately in their uniforms, their disciplined formation showcased the energy of patriotism that flowed through their veins. Their synchronized steps and perfect coordination paid homage to the valour and sacrifices of those who fought for India's freedom.</p>
