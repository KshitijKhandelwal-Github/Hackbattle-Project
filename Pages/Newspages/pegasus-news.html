            <p>The athletes of our institute have once again showcased their exceptional talent and 
                dedication by achieving remarkable success at the PEGASUS - 2023, a prestigious 
                National level tournament organized by the Christian Medical College & Hospital in Vellore. 
                This six-day sporting event, held from September 11th to September 16th, 2023, saw fierce 
                competition from across the country, and our Men's and Women's teams emerged as shining 
                stars, bringing immense pride and honour to Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT).

                The performances of our Men's and Women's teams in various sporting disciplines were 
                nothing short of outstanding. They exhibited not only their physical prowess but also 
                their unwavering determination and sportsmanship throughout the tournament. The medals 
                they secured were not just tokens of achievement; they symbolized the hours of 
                relentless training, the spirit of teamwork, and the indomitable will to succeed.</p>
