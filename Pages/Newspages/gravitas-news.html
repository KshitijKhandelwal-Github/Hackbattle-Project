            <p>Vellore Institute of Technology has always strived towards ensuring the technical development of the society. graVITas, Asia's one of the largest technical fests, is one such initiative towards fulfilling this responsibility.<br><br>

                The theme of this year's extravaganza will be with an objective of inspiring the student community to develop a product for solving real-world problems and challenges.<br><br>
                
                The dates for graVITas are set from the 22nd to the 24th of September, 2023, promising three days filled with a diverse array of technical events, competitions, workshops, and keynote lectures. These activities will not only challenge the intellectual capacity of participants but also provide a platform for networking and collaboration with like-minded individuals from diverse backgrounds.<br><br>
                
                Prior to the main event, pre-graVITas events have been scheduled from the 19th to the 22nd of September. These events will serve as a precursor, offering participants an opportunity to prepare and sharpen their skills in anticipation of the grand festivities to come. It also provides an extended period for engagement, ensuring that the excitement and learning opportunities associated with graVITas are extended over a more extended timeframe.<br><br>
                
                Throughout graVITas, participants can expect to delve into various technical domains, including but not limited to robotics, artificial intelligence, coding challenges, and engineering marvels. These activities not only promote healthy competition but also foster a culture of learning, innovation, and problem-solving.</p>
