            <p>On September 18, 2023, the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, observed a blissful holiday in honour of Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayak Chaturthi, a significant Hindu festival dedicated to celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity of wisdom and prosperity. This auspicious day was met with great enthusiasm and reverence by students, faculty, and staff alike. The entire campus was adorned with vibrant decorations, and a palpable sense of devotion filled the air.<br><br>

                The non-instructional day allowed devotees to immerse themselves completely in the festivities. In the early hours, students and staff gathered in the hostel premises to set up beautiful idols of Lord Ganesha. These idols were carefully crafted and decorated with intricate designs, flowers, and vibrant colours, making them a sight to behold. The atmosphere resonated with melodious bhajans (devotional songs) and the rhythmic beat of traditional drums, creating an ambiance of spiritual serenity.</p>
